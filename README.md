# LAB2-RNN
Laboratory earthquake prediction with RNNs 

A detailed file description can be found at the end of the report DL-LAB2.pdf.
Links to this repository and the data-set can also be found at the beginning of report.
X.csv and Y.csv are downsampled versions. The full data set needs to be downloaded from 
original source because it is too big.

The literature folder contains the two papers describing the experiment and the 
possibility of prediciting earthquakes. They are included for convenience.
